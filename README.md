# AirBnB Clone Project README

## Project Description

The AirBnB Clone project is a long-term project aimed at developing a simplified version of the AirBnB website. The project will span over the course of a year, and the primary objective is to create a web application that incorporates various fundamental concepts of higher-level programming. At the end of this project, you will have built a complete web application that includes:

- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, similar to a Shell. This command interpreter is useful for development and debugging.
- A website (the front-end) that showcases the final product, including static and dynamic elements.
- A data storage system that can persist objects, either in a database or files (data = objects).
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data, allowing you to retrieve, create, delete, and update objects.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is a crucial part of this project. It allows you to interact with and manipulate data, making it a valuable tool for development and debugging.

### How to Start It

To start the command interpreter, simply run the `console.py` file.

```bash
python console.py
```

### How to Use It

The command interpreter provides a set of commands for managing objects. You can use commands like create, show, destroy, update, and more to manipulate data. Refer to the provided documentation for a complete list of available commands and their usage.

### Examples

Here are some examples of using the command interpreter:

```bash
(hbnb) create User
(hbnb) show User 12345
(hbnb) destroy User 12345
(hbnb) all
(hbnb) update User 67890 first_name "John"
```

## Branches and Pull Requests

We encourage the use of branches and pull requests on GitHub to help organize and streamline the collaborative work on this project. This approach will make it easier for the team to manage and coordinate their efforts effectively.

## Concepts to Learn

Throughout the project, you'll have the opportunity to learn various concepts and technologies, including but not limited to:

- Unittest: Collaborate on test cases to ensure the reliability and functionality of the code.
- Python packages: Understand the concept of organizing code into packages.
- Serialization/Deserialization: Learn how to convert objects into serializable data and vice versa.
- \*args and \*\*kwargs: Explore how to work with dynamic function arguments.
- datetime: Manipulate date and time information.
- And more to come!

## Project Development Steps

The project will be developed in multiple steps, each focusing on specific aspects of the application. These steps are as follows:

1. The Console
   - Create your data model.
   - Manage (create, update, destroy, etc.) objects via a console/command interpreter.
   - Store and persist objects to a file (JSON file).
2. Web Static
   - Learn HTML/CSS.
   - Create the HTML structure of your application.
   - Create templates for each object.
3. MySQL Storage
   - Replace the file storage with a Database storage.
   - Map your data models to database tables using an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).
4. Web Framework - Templating
   - Create your first web server in Python.
   - Make your static HTML files dynamic by using objects stored in a file or database.
5. RESTful API
   - Expose all your objects stored via a JSON web interface.
   - Manipulate your objects via a RESTful API.
6. Web Dynamic
   - Learn JQuery.
   - Load objects from the client side using your own RESTful API.

## Project Structure

The project repository is organized as follows:

- `models` directory contains all classes used for the entire project. Each class represents an object or instance.
- `tests` directory contains all unit tests for the project.
- `console.py` is the entry point of the command interpreter.
- `models/base_model.py` is the base class for all models, containing common attributes and methods.
- `models/engine` directory contains storage classes, initially focusing on file storage.

## Storage

Persistency is crucial for a web application to retain data across multiple program executions. This project employs two types of storage: file storage and database storage. Initially, the project focuses on file storage. Separating "storage management" from "model" allows the models to be modular and independent, enabling easy switching between different storage systems without extensive code modifications.

## JSON Serialization

To store instances of objects in a file, they are converted into JSON format, a standard representation of objects. JSON serialization makes it easy to share data with other developers, as it is human-readable and can be understood by other languages or programs.

## \*args and \*\*kwargs

These concepts allow dynamic handling of function arguments. \*args represents anonymous arguments as a tuple, while \*\*kwargs represents named arguments as a dictionary. You can use these concepts to create flexible and dynamic functions.

## datetime

The datetime module is used to manipulate date and time information in Python. You can create, manipulate, and store date and time objects, making it essential for various aspects of the project.

## Data Diagram

A data diagram detailing the structure and relationships of the project's data models is available to provide a clear overview of how data is organized and interconnected.

Please note that the last line "A data diagram detailing the structure and relationships of the project's data models is available to provide a clear overview of how data is organized and interconnected." seems to be incomplete. You might want to add a link to the data diagram or provide more information about where it can be found.
